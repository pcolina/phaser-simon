# Phaser Test Game

This is a simple game created with Phaser. It's designed to fulfill the requirements given by my nephews for testing purposes, with its objective purely centered on learning to use Phaser.

This project relies on two core libraries:

- **Phaser** (^3.80.1): A versatile game development framework for JavaScript.
- **Vite** (^5.2.12): A rapid build tool enhancing development workflow, commonly used alongside Rollup or webpack for compression and bundling in production.


## Requirements

- Node.js installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/phaser-test-game.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies using npm:

## Usage

```npm run dev -o```
 
This will start a development server and open the game in your default web browser.
